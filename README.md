# Application Architecture Overview

### Components:

- **GitHub Workflows**: Automates the deployment process through CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions. It handles tasks such as building, testing, and deploying the application.

- **Container Registry**: A storage system for Docker images. After the application is built, the image is pushed here.

- **Container App**: A service that manages and scales the containerized application, pulling the Docker image from the Container Registry.

- **Function App**: A serverless compute service that runs event-triggered code, which does not require managing infrastructure.

- **Web App**: The interface for users, potentially a front-end service like WordPress, interacting with the Container App and Function App.

- **Resource Group**: In Azure, it's a collection that holds related resources for an Azure solution, including the Web App and Function App.

- **Users**: The end-users accessing the Web App.

### Data Flow:

1. **Code Push & CI/CD Trigger**: Developers push updates to GitHub, initiating the GitHub Workflows.

2. **Build & Image Push**: A Docker image is created and pushed to the Container Registry.

3. **Deployment**: The image is deployed to the Container App, and the Function App is set up to handle backend tasks.

4. **User Interaction**: Users interact with the Web App, which uses the other apps to serve content and perform actions.

5. **Resource Management**: All services are contained within an Azure Resource Group for easy management.

### Notations:

- "N/S" indicates Network/Security, marking where network traffic and security are crucial.

## Getting Started

To begin working with the application:

1. **Permissions**: Ensure access to the GitHub repository, Container Registry, and Azure Resource Group.

2. **Local Development**: Clone the repository and set up your local environment as per the project's guidelines.

3. **Deployment**: Refer to the GitHub Workflows for instructions on the CI/CD processes.

4. **Monitoring & Maintenance**: Post-deployment, use Azure's monitoring services to keep track of application performance and health, updating code and dependencies when necessary.

For a detailed breakdown of each component, refer to the Azure's service documentation.
